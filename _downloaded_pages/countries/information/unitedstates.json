People have been federally prosecuted for ayahuasca possession as recently as 2018. State law also typically outlaws DMT. However, federal courts have granted specific religious groups the right to use ayahuasca for ritual purposes. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, the Supreme Court heard arguments on November 1, 2005, and unanimously ruled in February 2006 that the U.S. federal government must allow the Brazil-based Uni\\u00E3o do Vegetal (UDV) church to import and consume ayahuasca for religious ceremonies under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act.In September 2008, the three Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status to import DMT-containing ayahuasca tea. The case, Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey, presided over by Judge Owen M. Panner, was ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church. As of March 21, 2009, a federal judge says members of the church in Ashland can import, distribute and brew ayahuasca. U.S. District Judge Owen Panner issued a permanent injunction barring the government from prohibiting or penalizing the sacramental use of \\\"Daime tea\\\". Panner's order said activities of The Church of the Holy Light of the Queen are legal and protected under freedom of religion. His order prohibits the federal government from interfering with and prosecuting church members who follow a list of regulations set out in his order. Except for ornamental purposes, growing, selling, or possessing Banisteriopsis spp. is prohibited by the Louisiana State Act 159.

In November 2020, more than 76 percent of voters in Washington D.C. voted in favor of the initiative to decriminalize entheogenic plants and fungi. In October 2021, Seattle's city council voted unanimously to decriminalize the cultivation and sharing of psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca, ibogaine, and non-peyote-derived mescaline.In November 2021, the city of Detroit made \\\"the personal possession and therapeutic use of entheogenic plants by adults the city's lowest law-enforcement priority.\\\"","sources":{"Wikipedia: Legal status of ayahuasca by country":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_ayahuasca_by_country"}},"yearOfData":2022,"values":[{"description":"Illegal, unless for religious use","title":"Possession","value":"Kinda Legal"},{"description":"Illegal, unless for religious use","title":"Sale","value":"Kinda Legal"},{"description":"Illegal, unless for religious use","title":"Transport","value":"Kinda Legal"},{"description":"Illegal, unless for religious use","title":"Cultivation","value":"Kinda Legal"}],"title":"Drug: Ayahuasca"},"Bitcoin":{"notes":"The U.S. Treasury classified bitcoin as a convertible decentralized virtual currency in 2013.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, classified bitcoin as a commodity in September 2015.

In 2005, the DEA seized 2,148.6 kg(4,736.8 lbs) of methamphetamine. In 2005, the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 was passed as part of the USA PATRIOT Act, putting restrictions on the sale of methamphetamine precursors.
