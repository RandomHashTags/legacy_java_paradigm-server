It is the 12th largest U.S. state in area and the 22nd most populous, with over 5.75 million residents. Minnesota is home to western prairies, now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Roughly a third of the state is covered in forests, and it is known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\" for having over 14,000 bodies of fresh water of at least ten acres. A little over half of Minnesotans live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, known as the \"Twin Cities\", the state's main political, economic, and cultural hub. The Twin Cities is the 16th largest metropolitan area in the U.S. Other minor metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas in the state include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester, and St. Cloud.","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota","statistics":{"area":{"Water":"7,309.09 sq mi (18,930 km2) 8.40%","Total":"86,935.83 sq mi (225,163 km2)","Land":"79,626.74 sq mi (206,232 km2)"},"Elevation":{"Elevation":"1,200 ft (370 m)","Lowest":"602 ft (183 m)","Highest":"2,301 ft (701 m)"},"dimensions":{"Length":"about 400 mi (640 km)","Width":"200\u2013350 mi (320\u2013560 km)"},"population":{"Median household income":"$74,593","Total":"5,707,390","Density":"68.9/sq mi (26.6/km2)"}}}},"NEIGHBORS":{"canada":["manitoba","ontario"],"unitedstates":["southdakota","iowa","northdakota","michigan","wisconsin"]}}
