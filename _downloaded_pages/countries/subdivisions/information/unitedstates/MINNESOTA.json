{"SERVICES":{"Wikipedia":{"paragraph":"Minnesota (/ˌmɪnɪˈsoʊtə/) is a state in the upper Midwestern United States. It is the 12th largest U.S. state in area and the 22nd most populous, with over 5.7 million residents. More than half of Minnesotans live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, known as the \"Twin Cities\", which is the main political, economic, and cultural hub. Greater Minneapolis is among the 20 largest metropolises in the U.S. Other Minnesota metropolitan areas include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester and St. Cloud. Minnesota's geography is highly diverse, consisting of western prairies, now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Roughly a third of the state is forested, and it is known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\" for having over 11,800 bodies of fresh water that are at least ten acres.","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"}},"NEIGHBORS":{"unitedstates":["South Dakota","Wisconsin","North Dakota","Iowa","Michigan"],"canada":["Ontario","Manitoba"]},"RESOURCES":{"Government Website":{"url":"https://mn.gov"},"Government Constitution":{"url":"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/constitution/"}}}
