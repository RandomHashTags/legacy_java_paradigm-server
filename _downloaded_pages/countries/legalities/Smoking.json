Anyone caught selling tobacco products to an under-aged person will be charged in court and can be fined up to 5,000 Singapore dollars for the first offense, and up to $10,000 for the second and subsequent offenses. In addition, the store involved will have the tobacco license suspended for 6 months at the first offense, and permanently revoked for the second offense. However, if the store involved is caught selling to minors in school uniform, or to minors below the age of 12, the tobacco license will be permanently revoked even at its first offense.
