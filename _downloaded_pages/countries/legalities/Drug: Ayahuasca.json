Before this, ayahuasca could be purchased in certain stores in the country, many online sellers of the substance were based in the Netherlands, and it was even possible to book an ayahuasca experience there, but things changed rapidly since the ruling by the Supreme Court. Santo Daime initially won a court case in 2001 which allowed them to continue their ceremonial usage of ayahuasca, but that ruling was also overturned. One factor in this initial decision was a fax from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health, stating that reparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention.","sources":{"Wikipedia: Legal status of ayahuasca by country":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_ayahuasca_by_country"}},"yearOfData":2021,"values":{"Sale":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Cultivation":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Possession":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Transport":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"}}}},"australia":{"Drug: Ayahuasca":{"notes":"Australia typically has harsh drug policies, but there appears to be no specific law dealing with ayahuasca.

People have been federally prosecuted for ayahuasca possession as recently as 2018. State law also typically outlaws DMT. However, federal courts have granted specific religious groups the right to use ayahuasca for ritual purposes. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, the Supreme Court heard arguments on November 1, 2005, and unanimously ruled in February 2006 that the U.S. federal government must allow the Brazil-based União do Vegetal (UDV) church to import and consume ayahuasca for religious ceremonies under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In September 2008, the three Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status to import DMT-containing ayahuasca tea. The case, Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey, presided over by Judge Owen M. Panner, was ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church. As of March 21, 2009, a federal judge says members of the church in Ashland can import, distribute and brew ayahuasca. U.S. District Judge Owen Panner issued a permanent injunction barring the government from prohibiting or penalizing the sacramental use of \"Daime tea\". Panner's order said activities of The Church of the Holy Light of the Queen are legal and protected under freedom of religion. His order prohibits the federal government from interfering with and prosecuting church members who follow a list of regulations set out in his order. Except for ornamental purposes, growing, selling, or possessing Banisteriopsis spp. is prohibited by the Louisiana State Act 159. In June 2019, the city of Oakland, California, in January 2020, the city of Santa Cruz, California, and in September 2020, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, decriminalized all \"entheogenic\" plants, including all natural materials used to produce ayahuasca. In November 2020, more than 76 percent of voters in Washington D.C. voted in favor of the initiative to decriminalize entheogenic plants and fungi.","sources":{"Wikipedia: Legal status of ayahuasca by country":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_ayahuasca_by_country"}},"yearOfData":2021,"values":{"Sale":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Cultivation":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Possession":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Transport":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"}}}},"denmark":{"Drug: Ayahuasca":{"notes":"Ayahuasca contains the drug DMT, which is on the list of illegal drugs in Denmark, making it illegal to import, produce, and consume.
