It is currently observed on the first Sunday in February, although in 2022 will be moved to the second Sunday, and is sometimes referred to as an unofficial national holiday. The 55th annual event, Super Bowl LV, occurred on February 7, 2021. Festivities for Super Sunday typically involve groups of people gathering to watch the game.
