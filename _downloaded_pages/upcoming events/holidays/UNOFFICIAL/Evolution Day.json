Such celebrations have been held for over a century, but the specific term \"Evolution Day\" for the anniversary appears to be a neologism which was coined prior to 1997. By highlighting Darwin's contributions to science, the day's events are used to educate about evolutionary biology. It is similar to the better-known Darwin Day, held on the anniversary of his birth (12 February 1809). It is unrelated to the secularization campaign by the Giordano Bruno Foundation to have the German public holiday of Ascension Day renamed to \"Evolutionstag\" (Evolution Day).","type":"UNOFFICIAL"}
