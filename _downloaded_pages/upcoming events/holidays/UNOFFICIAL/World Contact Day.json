IFSB members focused on the following message during 1953:\n\nCalling occupants of interplanetary craft! Calling occupants of interplanetary craft that have been observing our planet EARTH. We of IFSB wish to make contact with you. We are your friends, and would like you to make an appearance here on EARTH. Your presence before us will be welcomed with the utmost friendship. We will do all in our power to promote mutual understanding between your people and the people of EARTH. Please come in peace and help us in our EARTHLY problems. Give us some sign that you have received our message. Be responsible for creating a miracle here on our planet to wake up the ignorant ones to reality. Let us hear from you. We are your friends.\n\nThe 1953 celebration is referenced in the song \"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft\", created in 1976 by Klaatu and later covered by The Carpenters.\n\nOn the event's 60th anniversary in 2013, World Contact Day was extended to a whole week.","type":"UNOFFICIAL"}
