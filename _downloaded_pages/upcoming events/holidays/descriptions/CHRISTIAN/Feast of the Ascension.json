{"description":"The Feast of the Ascension of Jesus Christ, also called Ascension Day, Ascension Thursday, or sometimes Holy Thursday, commemorates the Christian belief of the bodily Ascension of Jesus into heaven. It is one of the ecumenical (i.e., universally celebrated) feasts of Christian churches, ranking with the feasts of the Passion, of Easter, and Pentecost. Following the account of Acts 1:3 that the risen Jesus appeared for 40 days prior to his Ascension, Ascension Day is traditionally celebrated on a Thursday, the fortieth day of Easter; although some Christian denominations have moved the observance to the following Sunday. In the Catholic Church in the United States, the day of observance varies by ecclesiastical province.","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Obereschach_Pfarrkirche_Fresko_Fugel_Christi_Himmelfahrt_crop.jpg/%quality%px-Obereschach_Pfarrkirche_Fresko_Fugel_Christi_Himmelfahrt_crop.jpg"}
