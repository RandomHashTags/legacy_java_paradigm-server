{"description":"All Souls' Day, also known as the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed and the Day of the Dead, is a day of prayer and remembrance for the souls of those who have died, which is observed by Latin Catholics and other Christian denominations annually on November 2. All Souls' Day is often celebrated in Western Christianity; Saturday of Souls is a related tradition more frequently observed in Eastern Christianity. Practitioners of All Souls' Day traditions often remember deceased loved ones in various ways on the day. Beliefs and practices associated with All Souls' Day vary widely among Christian denominations.\n\nThe annual celebration is the last day of Allhallowtide, after All Saints' Day and its eve. Prior to the standardization of Catholic observance on 2 November by St. Odlio of Cluny during the 10th century, many Catholic congregations celebrated All Souls Day on various dates during the Easter season as it is still observed in some Eastern Orthodox Churches and associated Eastern Catholic Churches. Churches of the East Syriac Rite (Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Ancient Church of the East) commemorate all the faithful departed on the Friday before Lent.","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_%281825-1905%29_-_The_Day_of_the_Dead_%281859%29.jpg/%quality%px-William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_%281825-1905%29_-_The_Day_of_the_Dead_%281859%29.jpg"}
