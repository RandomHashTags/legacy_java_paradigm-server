Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, California, Missouri, and New York observe the holiday.\n\nIn many other states, Lincoln's birthday is not celebrated separately, as a stand-alone holiday. Instead Lincoln's Birthday is combined with a celebration of President George Washington's birthday (also in February) and celebrated either as Washington's Birthday or as Presidents' Day on the third Monday in February, concurrent with the federal holiday."}
