{"description":"Liberation Day is a day, often a public holiday, that marks the liberation of a place, similar to an independence day. Liberation marks the date of either a revolution, as in Cuba, the fall of an oppressive regime, as in Portugal, or the end of an occupation by another state, as in the Netherlands, thereby differing from independence in the meaning of secession from another country.","imageURL":"null"}
