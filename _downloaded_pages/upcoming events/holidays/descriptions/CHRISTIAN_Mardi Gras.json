{"description":"Mardi Gras (/\u02C8m\u0251\u02D0rdi \u02CC\u0261r\u0251\u02D0/), or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove Tuesday. Mardi Gras is French for \"Fat Tuesday\", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating rich, fatty foods before the ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.\n\nRelated popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious obligations associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is derived from the word shrive, meaning \"to administer the sacrament of confession to; to absolve\".","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/KosmicFrenchmenPurpleFaceMardiGras2009.JPG/%quality%px-KosmicFrenchmenPurpleFaceMardiGras2009.JPG"}
