{"description":"Galactic Tick Day is an awareness and education day that celebrates the movement of the Solar System around the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nThe day occurs at a regular interval of 1.7361 years (or 633.7 days), which is called a galactic tick. The interval is derived from one centi-arcsecond of a galactic year, which is the Solar System's roughly 225-million-year trip around the Galactic Center. One galactic tick is only about 0.00000077 percent (1/) of a full galactic year.","imageURL":"null"}
