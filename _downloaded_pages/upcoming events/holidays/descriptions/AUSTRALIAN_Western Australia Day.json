{"description":"Western Australia Day or simply WA Day (formerly known as Foundation Day) is a public holiday in Western Australia, celebrated on the first Monday in June each year to commemorate the founding of the Swan River Colony in 1829. Because of the celebration of Western Australia Day, WA does not celebrate the Queen's Birthday Holiday in June, as do the other Australian states; it is held in September or October instead.","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Vlamingh_ships_at_the_Swan_River%2C_Keulen_1796.jpg/%quality%px-Vlamingh_ships_at_the_Swan_River%2C_Keulen_1796.jpg"}
