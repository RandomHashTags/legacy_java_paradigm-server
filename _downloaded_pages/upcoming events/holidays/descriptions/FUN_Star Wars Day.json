{"description":"Star Wars Day is an informal commemorative day observed annually on May 4 to celebrate George Lucas' Star Wars media franchise. Observance of the day spread quickly through media and grassroots celebrations since the franchise began in 1977.\n\nThe date originated from the pun \"May the Fourth be with you\", a variant of the popular Star Wars catchphrase \"May the Force be with you\". Even though the holiday was not created or declared by Lucasfilm, many Star Wars fans across the world have chosen to celebrate the holiday. It has since been embraced by Lucasfilm and parent company Disney as an annual celebration of Star Wars.","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Star_Wars_Day_May_The_Fourth.svg/%quality%px-Star_Wars_Day_May_The_Fourth.svg.png"}
