{"description":"Teachers' Day is a special day for the appreciation of teachers, and may include celebrations to honor them for their special contributions in a particular field area, or the community in general.\n\nThe idea of celebrating Teachers' Day took root in many countries during the 19th century; in most cases, they celebrate a local educator or an important milestone in education. This is the primary reason why countries celebrate this day on different dates, unlike many other International Days. For example, Argentina has commemorated Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's death on 11 September as Teachers\u2019 day since 1915. In India the birthday of the second president Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (5 September) is celebrated as Teacher's Day since 1962 and Guru Purnima is traditionally observed as a day to venerate teachers by Hindus.\n\nMany countries celebrate their Teachers' Day on 5 October in conjunction with World Teachers' Day, which was established by UNESCO in 1994.","imageURL":"null"}
