The concept was originally proposed in 1992 by Canada's International Centre for Ocean Development (ICOD) and the Ocean Institute of Canada (OIC) at the Earth Summit \\u2013 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. \\\"World Oceans Day\\\" was officially recognised by the United Nations in 2008. The international day supports the implementation of worldwide Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and fosters public interest in the protection of the ocean and the sustainable management of its resources.}}"}
