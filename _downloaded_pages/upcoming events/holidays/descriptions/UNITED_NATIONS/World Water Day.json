{"description":"World Water Day is an annual United Nations (UN) observance day held on 22 March that highlights the importance of fresh water. The day is used to advocate for the sustainable management of freshwater resources. The theme of each day focuses on topics relevant to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), which is in line with the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 6. The UN World Water Development Report (WWDR) is released each year around World Water Day.\n\nUN-Water is the convener for World Water Day and selects the theme for each year in consultation with UN organizations that share an interest in that year's focus. The theme for 2021 was \"Valuing Water\" and the public campaign invited people to join a global conversation on social media to \"tell us your stories, thoughts and feelings about water\".\n\nIn 2020, the theme was \"Water and Climate Change\". Previous themes for the years 2016 to 2019 were \"Water and Jobs'\", \"Why waste water?\" \"Nature for Water\", and \"Leaving no one behind\". World Water Day is celebrated around the world with a variety of events. These can be theatrical, musical or lobbying in nature. The day can also include campaigns to raise money for water projects. The first World Water Day, designated by the United Nations, was in 1993.","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/World_water_day_-_choir_singing_%284459460043%29.jpg/%quality%px-World_water_day_-_choir_singing_%284459460043%29.jpg"}
