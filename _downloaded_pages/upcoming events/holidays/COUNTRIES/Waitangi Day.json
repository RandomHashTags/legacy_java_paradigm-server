The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934, and it was made a national public holiday in 1974.\\n\\nIn present-day New Zealand, the anniversary is observed annually on 6 February and the day is usually recognised as a public holiday (if the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday is observed as the public holiday). Ceremonies take place at Waitangi and elsewhere to commemorate the signing of the treaty. A variety of events are staged, including parties, M\\u0101ori hui (social gatherings), reflections on New Zealand history, official awards and citizenship ceremonies. The commemoration has also been the focus of protest by M\\u0101ori activists, and is occasionally the focus of controversy.","type":"COUNTRIES"}
