This marked the beginning of the new year in the M\\u0101ori lunar calendar.\\n\\nMatariki was usually celebrated during the last quarter of the moon of the lunar month Pipiri (around June); the ceremony involved viewing the individual stars for forecasts of the year to come, mourning the deceased of the past year, and making an offering of food to replenish the stars. After the celebration of Matariki declined during the 20th century, it underwent a revival in the early 1990s. Matariki has been designated an official public holiday in New Zealand, to be celebrated for the first time on 24 June 2022.","type":"COUNTRIES"}
