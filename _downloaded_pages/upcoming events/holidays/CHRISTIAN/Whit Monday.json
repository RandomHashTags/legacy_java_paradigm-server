It is moveable because it is determined by the date of Easter. In the Catholic Church, it is the Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church Marking the resumption of Ordinary Time.\n\nWhit Monday gets its English name from \"Whitsunday\", an English name for Pentecost, one of the three baptismal seasons. The origin of the name \"Whit Sunday\" is generally attributed to the white garments formerly worn by those newly baptized on this feast.","type":"CHRISTIAN"}
