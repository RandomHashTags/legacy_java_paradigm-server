The United Nations has proclaimed it be observed globally on June 30 every year in its resolution. Asteroid Day aims to raise awareness about asteroids and what can be done to protect the Earth, its families, communities, and future generations from a catastrophic event. For example, 2014 HQ124, discovered April 23, 2014, went past 1,250,000 km from Earth the same year, June 8, only 46 days after discovery, and 2015 TB145, went past at 490,000 km only 21 days after its discovery.","type":"UNITED_NATIONS"}
