{"title":"Dune","description":"In the far future of humanity, Duke Leto Atreides accepts the stewardship of the dangerous desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, the only source of the most valuable substance in the universe, \"melange\" (known as \"spice\"), a drug that extends human life, provides superhuman levels of thought, and makes faster-than-light travel practical. Though Leto knows the opportunity is an intricate trap set by his enemies, he takes his Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, young son and heir Paul, and most trusted advisors to Arrakis. Leto takes control of the spice mining operation, which is made perilous by the presence of giant sandworms. A bitter betrayal leads Paul and Jessica to the Fremen, natives of Arrakis who live in the deep desert.","youtubeVideoIDs":["8g18jFHCLXk","w0HgHet0sxg","n9xhJrPXop4","hzUlXEyvJeA"],"imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FjNmEyNWMtYzM0ZS00NjIyLTg5YzYtYThlMGVjNzE1OGViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","properties":{"ratings":{"Rotten Tomatoes":89},"imdbInfo":{"genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"rating":"PG-13","ratingReason":"Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, some disturbing images and suggestive material","source":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/","runtimeSeconds":9300},"productionCompany":"Warner Bros.
