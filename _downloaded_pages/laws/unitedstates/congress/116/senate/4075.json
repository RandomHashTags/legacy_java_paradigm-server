Currently, the EDA may release the federal interest in a grant beginning 20 years after the grant was awarded.","policyArea":"Commerce","subjects":["Credit and credit markets","Economic development","Economic performance and conditions"],"cosponsors":[{"name":{"firstName":"Jon","lastName":"Tester"},"governedTerritory":"Montana","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/t000464_200.jpg","website":"http://www.tester.senate.gov/","party":"Democrat","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/jon-tester/T000464"},{"name":{"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Kaine"},"governedTerritory":"Virginia","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/k000384_200.jpg","website":"http://www.kaine.senate.gov/","party":"Democrat","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/timothy-kaine/K000384"},{"name":{"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Daines"},"governedTerritory":"Montana","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/d000618_200.jpg","website":"http://www.daines.senate.gov","party":"Republican","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/steve-daines/D000618"},{"name":{"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Merkley"},"governedTerritory":"Oregon","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/m001176_200.jpg","website":"http://www.merkley.senate.gov","party":"Democrat","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/jeff-merkley/M001176"},{"name":{"firstName":"Tina","lastName":"Smith"},"governedTerritory":"Minnesota","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/s001203_200.jpg","website":"https://www.smith.senate.gov","party":"Democrat","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/tina-smith/S001203"},{"name":{"firstName":"Joni","lastName":"Ernst"},"governedTerritory":"Iowa","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/e000295_200.jpg","website":"http://www.ernst.senate.gov","party":"Republican","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/joni-ernst/E000295"},{"name":{"firstName":"Roger","middleName":"F.","lastName":"Wicker"},"governedTerritory":"Mississippi","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/w000437_200.jpg","website":"http://www.wicker.senate.gov","party":"Republican","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/roger-wicker/W000437"},{"name":{"firstName":"Joe","middleName":"Manchin","lastName":"III"},"governedTerritory":"West Virginia","imageURL":"https://www.congress.gov/img/member/m001183_200.jpg","website":"http://www.manchin.senate.gov/","party":"Democrat","url":"https://www.congress.gov/member/joe-manchin/M001183"}],"actions":[{"chamber":"SENATE","title":"Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works discharged by Unanimous Consent.
