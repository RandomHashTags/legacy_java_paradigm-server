It will be the 45th Women's British Open, the 21st as a major championship on the LPGA Tour, and the second championship held under a sponsorship agreement with AIG, which has rebranded the championship to remove the word \"British\" and run as the 2021 AIG Women's Open.\nIt is the second Women\u2019s British Open at Carnoustie, following the course\u2019s event debut in 2011, which was won by Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng. The R&A also plans to allow the return of spectators, after the 2020 Women's British Open was played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.","title":"2021 Women's British Open"}
