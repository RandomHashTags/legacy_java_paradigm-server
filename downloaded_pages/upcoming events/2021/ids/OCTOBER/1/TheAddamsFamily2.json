{"title":"The Addams Family 2","description":"Morticia and Gomez are distraught that their children are growing up, skipping family dinners, and overly consumed with \\\"scream time\\\". To reclaim their bond, they decide to cram Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester, and the crew into their haunted camper and hit the road for one last miserable family vacation. Their adventure across the United States takes them out of their element and into run-ins with their cousin Itt and other kooky characters.","youtubeVideoIDs":["lBltLDC-EkI"],"imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ5NzJjMDgtNzhjMC00NTQ2LTgzOTUtZThiMWMwYmYwMGYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","properties":{"imdbInfo":{"genres":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy","Family","Fantasy","Horror"],"rating":"PG","ratingReason":"Rated PG for macabre and rude humor, violence and language","source":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/","runtimeSeconds":5580},"productionCompany":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer / Bron Animation"},"sources":{"Wikipedia: The Addams Family 2":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family_2"},"Official website":{"homepageURL":"https://www.unitedartistsreleasing.com/the-addams-family-2/"},"IMDb: The Addams Family 2":{"homepageURL":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11125620/"}}}
