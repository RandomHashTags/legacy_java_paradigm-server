{"title":"Dear Evan Hansen","description":"Evan Hansen is a teenager who suffers from social anxiety. His therapist recommends that he write letters to himself detailing what will be good about each day. His mother, Heidi, suggests that he ask people to sign the cast on his arm - caused by Evan falling out of a tree at Ellison State Park that summer - to make friends. Evan writes a letter to himself at school, wondering whether anyone would notice if he were not there (Waving Through A Window). Connor Murphy, a classmate of Evan's who is also friendless, offers to sign his cast. He happens upon Evan's letter and becomes furious at the mention of Zoe, believing that Evan wrote the letter to provoke him; he storms out with the letter in hand. Days later, Evan is called to the principal's office and is told by Connor's parents, Cynthia and Larry, that Connor has died by suicide, with Evan's letter found inside of his pocket. The two misinterpret the letter as a suicide note addressed to Evan, with Connor's name on his cast only strengthening their belief.","imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMwZTZhY2UtNWRjYy00MDc3LWE2MWUtZTg5NjVmZGY1NTdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMjM2NDc2._V1_.jpg","properties":{"imdbInfo":{"genres":["Drama","Musical"],"rating":"PG-13","ratingReason":"Rated PG-13 for thematic material involving suicide, brief strong language and some suggestive reference","source":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9357050/","runtimeSeconds":8220},"productionCompany":"Universal Pictures / Perfect World Pictures"},"sources":{"Wikipedia: Dear Evan Hansen (film)":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_Evan_Hansen_(film)"},"Official website":{"homepageURL":"https://www.dehmovie.com/"},"IMDb: Dear Evan Hansen":{"homepageURL":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9357050/"},"Rotten Tomatoes: Dear Evan Hansen":{"homepageURL":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dear_evan_hansen"}}}
