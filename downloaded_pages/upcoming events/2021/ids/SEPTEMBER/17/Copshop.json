{"title":"Copshop","description":"Screaming through the Nevada desert in a bullet-ridden Crown Vic, wily con artist Teddy Murretto hatches a desperate plan to hide out from lethal hitman Bob Viddick: He sucker-punches rookie officer Valerie Young to get himself arrested and locked up in a small-town police station. But jail can't protect Murretto for long. Viddick schemes his own way into detention, biding his time in a nearby cell until he can complete his mission. When the arrival of a competing assassin ignites all-out mayhem, mounting threats force Viddick to get creative if he wants to finish the job and escape the explosive situation. \\u2014\\u2009Open Road Films","youtubeVideoIDs":["zrOBP_B7DOA"],"imageURL":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTZjZWYzYjMtMmNlYi00MTdkLWI4OTMtMmVhM2QzZjZiZTZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY1MTg4Mzc@._V1_.jpg","properties":{"imdbInfo":{"genres":["Action","Thriller"],"rating":"R","ratingReason":"Rated R for strong/bloody violence, and pervasive language.","source":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5748448/","runtimeSeconds":6480},"productionCompany":"Open Road Films"},"sources":{"Wikipedia: Copshop":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copshop"},"Official website":{"homepageURL":"https://www.copshopmovie.com/"},"IMDb: Copshop":{"homepageURL":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5748448/"}}}
