{"description":"Easter Monday is the day after Easter Sunday and is a public holiday in some countries. It is the second day of Eastertide. In Western Christianity, it is also the second day of the Octave of Easter, and in Eastern Christianity, it is also the second day of Bright Week.\n\nEaster Monday is celebrated in the Catholic church and also called the Monday of the Angel \"because we recall the meeting of the angel with the women who arrived at Jesus\u2019s tomb. The angel said to them: \u201CI know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for he has risen. Because of this we call it Monday of the Angel because only an angel with the power of God could say that Jesus had risen\".(Regina Caeli, 2021)","imageURL":"null"}
