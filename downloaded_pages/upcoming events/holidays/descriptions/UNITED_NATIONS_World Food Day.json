{"description":"World Food Day is an international day celebrated every year worldwide on 16 October to commemorate the date of the founding of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 1945. The day is celebrated widely by many other organizations concerned with hunger and food security, including the World Food Programme and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. WFP received the Nobel Prize in Peace for 2020 for their efforts to combat hunger, contribute to peace in conflict areas, and for playing a leading role in stopping the use of hunger in the form of a weapon for war and conflict.\n\nThe World Food Day theme for 2014 was Family Farming: \"Feeding the world, caring for the earth\"; in 2015 it was \"Social Protection and Agriculture: Breaking the Cycle of Rural Poverty\"; in 2016 it is Climate Change: \"Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too\", which echoes the theme of 2008, and of 2002 and 1989 before that. The theme of 2020 was \"Grow, nourish, sustain. Together. Our actions are our future.\"","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/Worldfoodday2009logo.gif/%quality%px-Worldfoodday2009logo.gif"}
