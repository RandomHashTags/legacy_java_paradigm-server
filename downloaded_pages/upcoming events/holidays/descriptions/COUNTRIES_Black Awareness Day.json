{"description":"In Brazil, Black Awareness Day or Black Consciousness Day is observed annually on November 20 as a day \"to celebrate a regained awareness by the black community about their great worth and contribution to the country\".\n\nBlack Awareness Day has been celebrated since the 1960s and has amplified its events in the last few years. Originally, it was celebrated on May 13 (the date of abolition of slavery in Brazil). It was later moved to November 20 to honour Zumbi's death, and is sometimes called Zumbi Day. It is an official state holiday in Alagoas, Amazonas, Amap\u00E1, Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro, and marked elsewhere by multiple city councils.","imageURL":"null"}
