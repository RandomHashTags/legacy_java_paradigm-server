{"description":"The Cry of Dolores occurred in Dolores, Mexico, on 16 September 1810, when Roman Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla rang his church bell and gave the call to arms that triggered the Mexican War of Independence.\n\nEvery year on the eve of Independence Day, the President of Mexico re-enacts the cry from the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City, while ringing the same bell Hidalgo used in 1810.","imageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Dolores_hidalgo.jpg/%quality%px-Dolores_hidalgo.jpg"}
