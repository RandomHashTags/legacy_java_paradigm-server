One factor in this initial decision was a fax from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health, stating that reparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention.","values":[{"description":"Illegal","title":"Possession","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Sale","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Transport","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Cultivation","value":"Illegal"}]},{"country":"norway","notes":"It is illegal to prepare plants that contain narcotic drugs.","values":[{"description":"Illegal","title":"Possession","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Sale","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Transport","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Cultivation","value":"Illegal"}]},{"country":"peru","notes":"Superficial research suggests that ayahuasca is fully legal in Peru and there are many private companies and non-profits offering ayahuasca retreats.

People have been federally prosecuted for ayahuasca possession as recently as 2018. State law also typically outlaws DMT. However, federal courts have granted specific religious groups the right to use ayahuasca for ritual purposes. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, the Supreme Court heard arguments on November 1, 2005, and unanimously ruled in February 2006 that the U.S. federal government must allow the Brazil-based União do Vegetal (UDV) church to import and consume ayahuasca for religious ceremonies under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In September 2008, the three Santo Daime churches filed suit in federal court to gain legal status to import DMT-containing ayahuasca tea. The case, Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey, presided over by Judge Owen M. Panner, was ruled in favor of the Santo Daime church. As of March 21, 2009, a federal judge says members of the church in Ashland can import, distribute and brew ayahuasca. U.S. District Judge Owen Panner issued a permanent injunction barring the government from prohibiting or penalizing the sacramental use of \u0022Daime tea\u0022. Panner's order said activities of The Church of the Holy Light of the Queen are legal and protected under freedom of religion. His order prohibits the federal government from interfering with and prosecuting church members who follow a list of regulations set out in his order. Except for ornamental purposes, growing, selling, or possessing Banisteriopsis spp. is prohibited by the Louisiana State Act 159. In June 2019, the city of Oakland, California, in January 2020, the city of Santa Cruz, California, and in September 2020, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, decriminalized all \u0022entheogenic\u0022 plants, including all natural materials used to produce ayahuasca. In November 2020, more than 76 percent of voters in Washington D.C. voted in favor of the initiative to decriminalize entheogenic plants and fungi.","values":[{"description":"Illegal","title":"Possession","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Sale","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Transport","value":"Illegal"},{"description":"Illegal","title":"Cultivation","value":"Illegal"}]}]
