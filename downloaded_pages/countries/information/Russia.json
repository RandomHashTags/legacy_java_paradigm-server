Deputy Finance Minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Moiseev said in September 2017 it's \"probably illegal\" to accept cryptocurrency payments. However, bitcoin market sites are blocked, and court decisions state that bitcoin is a currency surrogate which is outlawed in the territory of the Russian Federation.\nFrom the point of view of the current Russian legislation, cryptocurrency is a monetary substitute. According to article 27 of the Federal Law \u201cOn the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia)\u201d, the issue of monetary surrogates in the Russian Federation is prohibited.\nThe Central Bank of Russia and Rosfinmonitoring in their informational appeals have repeatedly warned Russian citizens that all operations with cryptocurrency are speculative and carry a high risk of loss of value. The Central Bank of Russia states that: \"Most operations with cryptocurrencies are performed outside the legal regulation of both the Russian Federation and most other states. Cryptocurrencies are not guaranteed or provided by the Bank of Russia.\"\nA bill on digital financial assets was introduced in the State Duma on 20 March 2018. It defines cryptocurrency mining as \"activities aimed at the creation of cryptocurrency with the purpose of receiving compensation in the form of cryptocurrency.\" and treats it as an \"entrepreneurial activity subject to taxation if the miner exceeds the energy consumption limits established by the government for three months in a row.\"\nIn the bill, bitcoins are classified as property and are not considered legal tender. The exchange of cryptocurrency for rubles and foreign currency is allowed but only through licensed operators. The bill also provides a definition of a smart contract.:Russia","sources":{"Wikipedia: Legality of bitcoin by country or territory":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory"}},"values":{"Illegality":{"value":"Banking ban"},"Legality":{"value":"Legal to mine"}}},"Drug: Salvia Divinorum":{"notes":"Salvia divinorum was banned in Russian Federation since 31 December 2009.","sources":{"Wikipedia: Legal status of Salvia divinorum":{"homepageURL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_Salvia_divinorum"}},"yearOfData":2021,"values":{"Sale":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Cultivation":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"},"Possession":{"description":"Legal","value":"Legal"},"Transport":{"description":"Illegal","value":"Illegal"}}},"Marital Rape":{"notes":"Rape is illegal, and the law provides the same punishment for a relative, including the spouse, who commits rape as for a nonrelative.
